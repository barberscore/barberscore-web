    <p>
        Finalizing the Round generates <strong>FINAL</strong> versions of the OSS, SA, Song Titles and Announcements and emails the SA to the panel. These are not made public until the next step, but Finalizing should mean that no further changes are expected, especially to the scores. Pay particular attention to the OSS for accuracy and completeness, making manual adjustments in the Appearances, Outcomes, and Draw as necessary <strong>BEFORE YOU VERIFY</strong>.

        <strong>IMPORTANT:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Please take the time to review all the reports thoroughly!
