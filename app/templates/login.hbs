          It says I have wrong email and password; what do I do?
        {{/bs-button}}
      </li>
      {{#bs-collapse collapsed=faq1}}
        <p>
          There are three main ways to solve this:
        </p>
        <p>
          First, be sure you are using the same email address you use to access the {{member-center}}. Only persons with a BHS account can access Barberscore.
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, if this is the first time you're logging in to Barberscore, you need to create a password by choosing the "Forgot Your Password" link in the login form.  You'll be sent an email allowing you to create a new password.  This can be any password you like, including the same password you currently use on the {{member-center}} itself.  We're sorry to require this additional step, but for security purposes Barberscore and the Member Center do not share user passwords.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, if you're sure you have the right email and have logged in before, it might just be that you're using the wrong password!  Click on the Forgot Password link to get a new one.
        </p>
      {{/bs-collapse}}
      <li>
      {{#bs-button type='link' onClick=(toggle 'faq2' this)}}
        I've asked for a new password but never get the email.  What do I do?
      {{/bs-button}}
      </li>
      {{#bs-collapse collapsed=faq2}}
        <p>
          First, be sure to check your spam or junk mail folders.
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, there is a chance an errant report is blocking all email to your address.  If you have checked your spam/junk mail folder and still don't see our email, please reach out to {{customer-support}} to lift that block.
        </p>
      {{/bs-collapse}}
      <li>
      {{#bs-button type='link' onClick=(toggle 'faq3' this)}}
        I've tried everything and still can't log in.
      {{/bs-button}}
      </li>
      {{#bs-collapse collapsed=faq3}}
        <p>
          When all else fails, please contact {{customer-support}} and we'll do all we can to help.
        </p>
      {{/bs-collapse}}
      <li>
      {{#bs-button type='link' onClick=(toggle 'faq4' this)}}
        Who can login to Barberscore?
      {{/bs-button}}
      </li>
      {{#bs-collapse collapsed=faq4}}
        <p>
          Barberscore is accessible to all persons that have an account with the BHS {{member-center}}.  In Barberscore you'll have read-only access to all the active quartets and choruses with which you have a current membership.  Those who have administrative access (such as Quartet Admins and Chorus Managers) are also able to take actions such as enter contests or change musical repertory.
        </p>
      {{/bs-collapse}}
      <li>
      {{#bs-button type='link' onClick=(toggle 'faq5' this)}}
        I have another question -- where can I get it answered?
      {{/bs-button}}
      </li>
      {{#bs-collapse collapsed=faq5}}
